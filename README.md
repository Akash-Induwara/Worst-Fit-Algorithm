Worst Fit Memory Allocation Algorithm

Introduction-
This project implements the Worst Fit memory allocation algorithm in Python. The Worst Fit algorithm is a dynamic memory management technique that allocates memory requests to the largest available memory block. This approach aims to leave smaller blocks available for future requests, minimizing fragmentation in certain scenarios.
The project includes a Python program that simulates the allocation process, handles various input scenarios, and outputs the results, including unallocated requests and remaining memory block sizes.

Features-
Dynamically allocates memory using the Worst Fit strategy.
Handles user-provided input for memory blocks and requests.
Displays allocation results and updates remaining memory block sizes.
Handles cases where requests cannot be allocated due to insufficient memory.
Includes detailed comments and modular code for clarity and reusability.

Future Enhancements-
Add support for merging adjacent free blocks to reduce fragmentation.
Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing memory allocation.
Implement other memory allocation strategies (e.g., Best Fit, First Fit) for comparison.
